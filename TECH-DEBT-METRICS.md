Kraven's organization scanning now includes comprehensive tech debt impact analysis, providing quantifiable metrics for cost, time, security risk, and business impact. These metrics help organizations make data-driven decisions about technical debt management.

## 📊 Metrics Categories

### 💰 Financial Impact
Quantifies the monetary cost of technical debt across the organization.

#### Estimated Annual Cost
- **Calculation**: Based on repository health, maintenance requirements, and developer time
- **Formula**: `(poor_repos * $2,400) + (fair_repos * $1,200) + (critical_repos * $6,000) annually`
- **Purpose**: Budget planning for technical debt remediation

#### Cost per Repository (Monthly)
- **Calculation**: Average monthly maintenance cost per repository
- **Formula**: `total_annual_cost / 12 / repository_count`
- **Purpose**: Resource allocation and prioritization

#### Security Incident Risk Cost
- **Calculation**: Potential cost of security breaches based on repository visibility
- **Formula**: `critical_repos * $50,000 * reputation_multiplier`
- **Reputation Multiplier**: 
  - High-profile (>1000 stars): 3x
  - Medium-profile (>100 stars): 2x
  - Low-profile: 1x
- **Purpose**: Risk assessment and insurance planning

#### Opportunity Cost
- **Calculation**: Lost productivity due to technical debt
- **Formula**: `developer_count * hourly_rate * annual_hours * productivity_loss_percentage`
- **Purpose**: Understanding hidden costs of technical debt

### ⏰ Time Investment Required
Estimates the human hours needed to address technical debt.

#### Total Maintenance Hours
- **Critical repos**: 16 hours each (2 developer days)
- **Poor repos**: 8 hours each (1 developer day)
- **Fair repos**: 4 hours each (half developer day)
- **Abandoned projects**: 12 hours each (1.5 developer days)

#### Average Hours per Repository
- **Calculation**: `total_maintenance_hours / repository_count`
- **Purpose**: Sprint planning and resource allocation

#### Critical Issue Hours
- **Focus**: Security vulnerabilities and blocking issues
- **Priority**: Immediate attention required
- **Calculation**: `critical_repos * 16 hours`

#### Dependency Update Hours
- **Focus**: Outdated packages and libraries
- **Calculation**: `(poor_repos * 8) + (fair_repos * 4) hours`
- **Purpose**: Maintenance sprint planning

### 🛡️ Security Risk Assessment
Comprehensive security risk scoring and vulnerability analysis.

#### Overall Risk Score (0-100)
- **Critical repos**: 40% weight
- **Poor repos**: 25% weight  
- **Abandoned projects**: 35% weight
- **Interpretation**:
  - 0-20: Low risk
  - 21-40: Medium risk
  - 41-60: High risk
  - 61-80: Very high risk
  - 81-100: Critical risk

#### Vulnerability Estimates
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: `critical_repos * 2.5`
- **High vulnerabilities**: `(poor_repos + critical_repos) * 1.8`
- **Based on**: Industry averages from CVE databases

#### Outdated Dependencies
- **Critical repos**: 25 outdated dependencies each
- **Poor repos**: 15 outdated dependencies each
- **Fair repos**: 8 outdated dependencies each

#### Compliance Risk Levels
- **Critical**: >30% of repos have critical issues
- **High**: >15% of repos have critical issues
- **Medium**: >40% of repos have poor health
- **Low**: Good overall health

### 📈 Business Impact
Measures the broader organizational impact of technical debt.

#### Productivity Loss (%)
- **Calculation**: `min(50%, abandoned_projects_percentage * 100)`
- **Impact**: Developer time spent on workarounds and maintenance
- **Range**: 0-50% maximum

#### Deployment Risk Score (0-100)
- **Calculation**: `security_risk_score * 0.8`
- **Impact**: Risk of production issues and downtime
- **Purpose**: Release planning and risk management

#### Talent Retention Impact (0-100)
- **Calculation**: `max(0, 100 - (productivity_loss * 1.5))`
- **Impact**: Developer satisfaction and retention risk
- **Research**: High tech debt correlates with developer turnover

#### Innovation Delay (Months)
- **Calculation**: `(abandoned_projects / total_repos) * 12 months`
- **Impact**: Delayed feature development due to maintenance burden
- **Purpose**: Strategic planning and roadmap prioritization
